;;; Code:

;;; Speed up startup
;;
;; Process performance tuning
(setq-default process-adaptive-read-buffering nil)

;; Reduce rendering/line scan work for Emacs by not rendering cursors or regions
;; in non-focused windows
(setq-default cursor-in-non-selected-windows nil)
(setq highlight-nonselected-windows nil)

;; More performant rapid scrolling over unfontified regions. May cause brief
;; spells of inaccurate fontification immediately after scrolling
(setq fast-but-imprecise-scrolling t)

;; Introduced in Emacs 30, this inhibits fontification while
;; receiving input, which should help a little with scrolling performance
(setq redisplay-skip-fontification-on-input t)

;; Resizing the Emacs frame can be a terribly expensive part of changing the
;; font. By inhibiting this, we halve startup times, particularly when we use
;; fonts that are larger than the system default (which would resize the frame)
(setq frame-inhibit-implied-resize t)

;; Don't ping things that look like domain names
(setq ffap-machine-p-known 'reject)

;; Don't pass case-insensitive to `auto-mode-alist'
(setq auto-mode-case-fold nil)

;; Disable bidirectional text scanning for a modest performance boost
(setq-default bidi-display-reordering 'left-to-right
              bidi-paragraph-direction 'left-to-right)

;; Disabling BPA makes redisplay faster, but might produce incorrect
;; reordering of bidirectional text with embedded parentheses
(setq bidi-inhibit-bpa t)

;; Emacs "updates" its ui more often than it needs to, so slow it down slightly
(setq idle-update-delay 1.0)            ; default is 0.5

;; Increase how much is read from processes in a single chunk (default is 4kb).
(setq-default read-process-output-max (* 1024 1024)) ; 1024kb

;; Font compacting can be terribly expensive, especially for rendering icon
;; fonts on Windows. Whether disabling it has a notable affect on Linux and Mac
;; hasn't been determined, but do it anyway, just in case. This increases memory
;; usage.
