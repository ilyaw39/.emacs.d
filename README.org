This is a simple setup for Emacs 29+ focusing on scientific writing in Org mode.

This configuration is designed for my personal uses. You may get installation error
and be confused if you use this repositary as your Emacs's configuration home directory.

I am now working on a new project for general usage. The detailed installation
instructions and documentations will be denoted in that project.
