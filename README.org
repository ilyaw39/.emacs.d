*** Features

- [[https://github.com/tecosaur][TEC]]'s patched Org integration, optimizing on LaTeX edition ([[https://code.tecosaur.net/tec/org-mode][org-latex-preview]])
- Exquisite UI design. Pursuit of excellence in performance
- Simple, lightweight, and up-to-date configuration. Easy to customize

This project is still being improved. An important feature I hope to integrate is the
combination with the Python API to fully leverage the advantages of LLMs.

I'll find time to complete the user manual for this project, and I really hope you can
benefit from it.
