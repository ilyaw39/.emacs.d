#+title: Hl-Column - Highlight the current column

Provides a local minor mode (toggled by =M-x hl-column-mode=) and a
global minor mode (toggled by =M-x global-hl-column-mode=) to
highlight, on a suitable terminal, the line on which point is.

You probably don't really want to use the global mode; if the cursor
is difficult to spot, try changing its color, relying on
~blink-cursor-mode~ or both.

* Installation

Hl-Column isn't available on any ELPA right now.  So, you have to
follow one of the following methods:

** Quelpa

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(quelpa '(hl-column
          :fetcher git
          :url "https://codeberg.org/akib/emacs-hl-column.git"))
#+end_src

** Straight.el

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package
 '(hl-column :type git
             :repo "https://codeberg.org/akib/emacs-hl-column.git"))
#+end_src

** Manual

Download =hl-column.el= and put it in your ~load-path~.
